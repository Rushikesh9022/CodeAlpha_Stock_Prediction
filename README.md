Stock Prediction 

Step 1: Importing Libraries
NumPy: For numerical computations and array handling.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis, with structures like DataFrames.
Scikit-learn: Includes tools for machine learning and statistical modeling.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization, enabling various plots and charts.

Step 2: Loading the Dataset
Load the dataset from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation and analysis.

Step 3: Data Preprocessing
Handling Missing Values:
Numeric Columns: Fill missing values with the median.
Categorical Columns: Fill missing values with the mode.
Converting Categorical Features to Numerical: Use one-hot encoding to convert categorical variables into a numerical format.

Step 4: Feature Engineering
Split data into:
Features (X): Input variables for predictions (all columns except the target).
Target Variable (y): Output variable to predict, e.g., 'SalePrice'.

Step 5: Data Splitting
Divide the dataset into training (80%) and testing sets (20%).

Step 6: Feature Scaling
Standardize features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 to ensure equal contribution.

Step 7: Model Training
Random Forest Regressor: Train the model using an ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees.

Step 8: Model Evaluation
Evaluate performance using:
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average squared difference between actual and predicted values.
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average absolute difference between actual and predicted values.
RÂ² Score: Indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable predictable from the independent variables.

Step 9: Feature Importance
Evaluate and display the top 10 most important features for predictions using a bar chart.

Step 10: Visualization
Use a scatter plot to compare actual house prices with predicted prices, assessing the model's performance visually.
